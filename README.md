# [Transparent File Encryption SDK](https://www.easefilter.com/Forums_Files/Transparent_Encryption_Filter_Driver.htm)
 A C# transparent file encryption example was implemented with the Transparent File Encryption Filter Driver SDK. The transparent file encryption performs real-time I/O encryption and decryption of the files in any block data with 16 bytes. The encryption uses a 256 bits symmetric key to encrypt or decrypt the data with AES encryption algorithm. Auto file encryption protects data "at rest", meaning the transparent data and files encryption. It provides the ability to comply with policies which can be applied by users, processes and file type. This allows only authorized users and processes to access the encrypted files, unauthorized users and processes canâ€™t access the encrypted files.

## The features of the EaseFilter Encryption SDK:
1. **Completely transparent file encryption in file system level.**
2. **Random block level decryption.**
3. **High encryption or decryption performance.**
   

## The products you can develop with EaseFilter Encryption SDK:

1. **Data encryption at rest.** Encryption at rest prevents the attacker from accessing the unencrypted data by ensuring the data is encrypted when on disk.
Data protection.

2. **Document encryption.** File encryption is very important step for data protection, only the authorized users or processes can read the encrypted data, or will get the raw encrypted data.

3. **Data loss prevention.** To prevent the data breach, your data is encrypted all the time, even your data was lost and found in an unauthorized place, they are protected against the unauthorized access.

4. **Secure file sharing with DRM.**
Encrypted your files with digital rights management data embedded into the encrypted header, protect, track and control your encrypted files anywhere anytime, you can grant or revoke the access control to any user at any time even the files were shared.

## A C# Auto File Encryption Example
With the C# auto file encryption example, you can setup an encryption folder in computer A, configure the authorized processes, users who can read the encrypted file, then you can setup the decryption folder in computer B, you can copy the encrypted file to this folder, and configure the authorized processes which can read the encrypted files in the decryption folder.
